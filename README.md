# Shopper-Signals-What-Search-Data-Tells-Us-About-Trust-Value-and-Doubt

Challenge –
While online search data provides raw insights into what consumers are searching for, it often lacks the structured depth to inform strategic marketing and product decisions. Retailers struggle to decode why people search — what psychological intent drives that behavior?

Goal –
Build a keyword-based behavioral segmentation model using Google Trends data to group shoppers based on psychological drivers (e.g., trust, price sensitivity, convenience). Then analyze interest trends over time, volatility, and seasonality — and visualize the insights in Power BI.

Segmentation Approach
Grouped 12 shopping-related keywords into 4 behavioral clusters:

Value Seekers
"promo codes fashion", "student discount", "free shipping"
Highly price-sensitive, deal-driven shoppers

Trust Seekers
"ethical brands", "return policy", "verified reviews"
Want assurance, reliability, and ethical transparency

Convenience Seekers
"same day delivery", "pickup near me", "try before you buy"
Prioritize speed and ease of shopping

Skeptical Explorers
"Temu vs Shein", "best product review", "Amazon fake reviews"
Research-heavy, cautious, questioning credibility

Interpretation:
Deals Drive Attention
“Student discount” tops the chart — Gen Z and young buyers are actively hunting for budget-friendly shopping opportunities. This confirms how price sensitivity is shaping online behavior.

Hyperlocal Convenience Is Key
“Pickup near me” scoring second shows how much consumers value instant access and local options — especially post-pandemic where fast and nearby has become the new normal.

Trust & Research Matter
The presence of “ethical brands”, “return policy”, and even “Temu vs Shein” reflects a shopper who doesn't just buy — they pause, question, and verify. Consumers are comparing platforms, checking legitimacy, and looking for fair practices before purchasing.

These searches validate the value of platforms that surface trusted, transparent, and value-driven product information. Your mission is exactly what these shoppers are looking for.
